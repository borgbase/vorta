      <title>v0.11.0</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>After 2 months of testing we are ready to release the next major version of Vorta. Much of this was contributed by our Google Summer of Code student, @VandalByte. A big thanks to him for all his work over the summer.</p>
<h2>Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Change passphrase feature (#2224) — Users can now change their repository passphrase directly from Vorta's UI, eliminating the need to drop to the command line for this common security operation. This was a long-requested feature dating back to issue #303.</li>
<li>Unified file selector (#2237) — Replaces the confusing dual-dialog approach (separate dialogs for files vs folders) with a single tree-view selector that supports multi-selection for both. This addresses a longstanding UX pain point caused by Qt limitations.</li>
<li>Fix GUI freezing during pre-backup commands (#2214) — Pre-backup scripts that took more than a few seconds would freeze the entire interface until completion. The backup now runs asynchronously, keeping the UI responsive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>All changes</h2>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Overdue release that combines many bug fixes, refactoring and maintenance tasks in particular by our Google Summer of Code student, @shivansh02.</p>

<ul>
<li>For macOS there is an Arm64 version attached, which will open much faster than the previous Intel build. The bundled Borg binary is still Intel, so it's best to install Borg via Homebrew.</li>
<li>To install with pip: <code>pip install vorta==0.10.0</code></li>
