# Vorta Backup Client <img alt="Logo" src="https://files.qmax.us/vorta/vorta-512px.png" align="right" height="50">

Vorta is a backup client for macOS and Linux desktops. It integrates the mighty [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io) with your desktop environment to protect your data from disk failure, ransomware and theft.

## Why is this great? ðŸ¤©

- **Encrypted, deduplicated and compressed backups** using [Borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io) as backend.
- **No vendor lock-in** â€“Â back up to local drives, your own server or [BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com), a hosting service for Borg backups.
- **Open source** â€“Â free to use, modify, improve and audit.
- **Flexible profiles** to group source folders, backup destinations and schedules.
- **One place** to view all point-in-time archives and restore individual files.

## Installation
Vorta should work on all platforms that support Qt and Borg. This includes macOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux and many others. Windows is currently not supported by Borg, but this may change in the future.

### Distribution Packages
If available, prefer distribution-specific packages, as they offer better integration.

**Apple macOS**: Install via [Homebrew Cask](https://brew.sh/) or download a pre-built app bundle for macOS (10.13+) from [Releases](https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/releases).
```
$ brew cask install vorta
```
**Arch Linux**: Use the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vorta/) maintained by [@bjo81](https://github.com/bjo81).
```
$ yaourt -S vorta
```

### Install from Source
The generic way is to install it as Python package using [PIP](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/). First [install](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) Borg using the package of your distribution or via PyPI. The latter needs some additional [source packages](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#dependencies). Then install Vorta from PyPI. Your local Python version should be >= 3.6.
```
$ pip3 install vorta
```

### Why the Name?
