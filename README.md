Vorta is a backup client for macOS and Linux desktops. It integrates the powerful [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io) with your desktop environment to protect your data from disk failure, ransomware and theft.

## Why is this great? ðŸ¤©

- **Encrypted, deduplicated and compressed backups** using [Borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io) as backend.
- **No vendor lock-in** â€“Â back up to local drives, your own server or [BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com), a hosting service for Borg backups.
- **Open source** â€“Â free to use, modify, improve and audit.
- **Flexible profiles** to group source folders, backup destinations and schedules.

## Installation
Vorta should work on all platforms that support Qt and Borg.

### macOS
Install via [Homebrew Cask](https://brew.sh/) or download a pre-built app bundle for macOS (10.13+) from [Releases](https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/releases).
```
$ brew cask install vorta
```

### As Python Package
First [install](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) Borg using the package of your distribution or via PyPI. The latter needs some additional [source packages](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#dependencies). Then install Vorta from PyPI. Your local Python version should be >= 3.6. Python 2 is not supported.
```
$ pip3 install vorta
```
