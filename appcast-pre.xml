      <title>v0.9.1-beta3</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We are almost ready for the first 0.9 release. This beta finally merges the new GUI to better manage file exclusions by @diivi. Some things you can now do around exclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>We ship exclusion presets for common use cases. Currently there are just a few, but we hope to add more over time. PRs welcome, if you have good exclusion lists around a specific topic.</li>
<li>Add your own exclusions and enable/disable them individually</li>
<li>You can always view the final exclusion list under <em>Preview</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your existing exclusions can be found in the <em>Raw</em> tab. They will continue to be used as-is.</li>
<li>The "Exclude if present" feature isn't implemented in the new exclusion dialog yet. If you use this feature, you can manually add --exclude-if-present .nobackup in <em>Schedule -&gt; Shell commands -&gt; Extra arguments</em> for borg create.</li>
</ul>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm proud to release the second beta version of our new 0.9 branch. With <a href="https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2023-Ideas">Google Summer of Code</a> at full steam over the summer, the team got a lot done, with a <a href="https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/pull/1742">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/pull/1809">major</a> <a href="https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/pull/1749">features</a> still pending for the next beta.</p>
<p>Thanks are also due to our mentors, who guided contributors while working on their pull requests. üëè @real-yfprojects @Hofer-Julian </p>
<p>Please share your feedback <a href="https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/issues/1823">here</a>, so we can keep improving this branch until the final release.</p>
<h3>Breaking changes</h3>
<p>This Vorta version ships with Borg 1.2.6 (when using our macOS app), which fixes an issue with data authentication. So you may get an error saying "Data integrity error: Archive authentication did not verify". In that case, at a minimum, if you trust the repository, you need to run the following upgrade steps. Full details are described in <a href="https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/1.2.6/docs/changes.rst#pre-125-archives-spoofing-vulnerability-cve-2023-36811">Borg's release notes</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the repository URL. You can do this in Vorta's <em>Repository</em> tab using the <em>Copy to clipboard</em> button next to the repository selector.</li>
<li>Ensure you have the repo passphrase ready. Vorta would keep it in the OS' keychain usually.</li>
<li>Run this in the terminal: <code>BORG_WORKAROUNDS=ignore_invalid_archive_tam borg upgrade --archives-tam $REPO_URL</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Selected major features and improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can now give names to repos to manage them more easily. By @diivi (#1665)</li>
<li>There are now separate unit tests and integration tests with live Borg installs, as well as higher test coverage. By @jetchirag and @bigtedde</li>
<li>Password entry is now done with a reusable widget. By @jetchirag, #1662 </li>
<li>Vorta now uses Qt6 for the interface. #1685, by @i1sm3ky</li>
<li>@sten0 from Debian helped us to clean up our icon licensing situation. #1729</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Add mount option override checkbox. By @samuel-w (#682)</li>
